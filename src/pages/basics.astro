    <h1>Diophantine Approximation — The Simple Version</h1>
    <p>
      How closely can a real number be approximated by rationals? Diophantine Approximation studies inequalities of the form
      {math1}
      where <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are integers and <em>q</em> is positive. The smaller the error for a given <em>q</em>, the &ldquo;better&rdquo; the approximation.
    </p>

    <h2>Why care?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It explains why continued fractions give excellent approximations.</li>
      <li>It underlies results in dynamics, geometry of numbers, and cryptography.</li>
      <li>It powers practical tasks like frequency estimation and synchronization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dirichlet’s Guarantee</h2>
    <p>
      For any real number <em>x</em> and positive integer <em>Q</em>, there exist integers <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> with <em>1 \le q \le Q</em> such that

    <p>
      This already ensures infinitely many rational approximations with error better than <code>1/q^2</code> by letting <em>Q=q</em> and sending <em>q</em> to infinity.
    </p>

    <h2>Continued Fractions</h2>
    <p>
      The convergents of the continued fraction of <em>x</em> (fractions obtained by truncating the expansion) give some of the best possible approximations. For example, with \(x=\varphi=(1+\sqrt5)/2\):

      where \(F_n\) are Fibonacci numbers.
