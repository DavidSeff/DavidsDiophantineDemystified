    <h1>Diophantine Approximation â€” Advanced Overview</h1>
    <p>
      This page collects more formal statements, refinements, and context. It is intended for readers comfortable with analysis and number theory.
    </p>

    <h2>Classical Statements</h2>
    <h3>Dirichlet&rsquo;s Theorem (Simultaneous Form)</h3>
    <p>
      For any real <em>x</em> and positive integer <em>Q</em>, there exist integers <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> with <em>1 \le q \le Q</em> such that
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">{math1}</p>

    <h3>Hurwitz&rsquo;s Theorem</h3>
    <p>
      There exists a constant \\(c=\\frac&#123;1&#125;&#123;\\sqrt{5}&#125;\\) such that for any irrational \\(x\\), there are infinitely many rationals \\(p/q\\) with
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">{math2}</p>
    <p>
      The constant is best possible (attained by the golden ratio and its equivalents).
    </p>

    <h2>Continued Fractions and Best Approximations</h2>
    <p>
      Convergents p_n/q_n of the continued fraction of x are best approximations: any fraction a/b with denominator b at most q_n cannot achieve a smaller error than p_n/q_n.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">{math3}</p>

    <h2>Metric Results</h2>
    <p>
      Khintchine&rsquo;s theorem relates the measure of numbers satisfying {inlineMeasure} infinitely often to a divergence test on {inlineSum}. Jarnik&ndash;Besicovitch theorems refine to Hausdorff dimension.
    </p>

    <h2>Geometry of Numbers</h2>
    <p>
      Minkowski's convex body theorem gives clean lattice-based proofs of Dirichlet-type bounds and generalizations to linear forms.
